orphan
child process in running
parent work is done and its gone is called orphan


zombie
task is completed but entry is in table is called zombie
A process which has finished the execution but still has entry in the process table to report to its parent
process is known as a zombie process. A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from
the process table. The parent process reads the exit status of the child process which reaps off the child
process entry from the process table.
