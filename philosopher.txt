/*
A process is basically a program in execution.

2 same process cannot access same shared resources and data.

spliting of application into tasks

2 or more operations at same time

semaphore :- solve critical section problem by using wait and signal
mutex :- simply a lock aquire before entering a critical section and releasing it
thread :- a single sequential flow of activity.
deadlock :- situation where no process block and no process procced.
starvation :- situation where low priority process will block and high priority proceed.
